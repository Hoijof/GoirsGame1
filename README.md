GoirsGame1
==========

GoirsGame1 it's a combat simulation project which main goal is to create a base engine for any future games. The idea is to create THE combat engine to all the future games that we develop.

Characteristics of the engine

Medium load

Works smoothly with 300 entities fighting at the same time. This engine is designed to work at 100% speed with ~150 entities fighting at the same time, that means that you can have 1 main character fighting monsters and half of the world leveling up on its own dynamically.

Non complex algorithms

We put strong emphasis in making our algorithms real, but light. We try to deduce what reality looks like and adapt our game to it. Having in mind that we don't have a high load engine the attributes that we have are limited thus we have to do some guessing when simulating reality and the engine may not be 100% accurate (it's not its goal).
